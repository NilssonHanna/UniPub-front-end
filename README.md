Title: UniPub

Project Description:

The project focuses on the development of UniPub, a mobile app designed to enhance the student life in Uppsala. UniPub's primary objective is to provide real-time updates on seat availability in different student nations. Additionally, the app offers a map feature that aids in locating each nation, particularly beneficial for new students navigating the area.

The app is built using the MERN-stack, incorporating MongoDB as the database solution, Express.js for web application framework, React.js for user interface development, and Node.js as the backend runtime environment. This combination of tools harmoniously creates an efficient development environment.

To securely store the user credentials of the nations, Back4App is employed as a chosen backend-as-a-service platform. Back4App provides diverse features, including Database Management based on MongoDB.
